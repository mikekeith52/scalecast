- Modified example grids.
### Fixed

## [0.18.3] - 2023-04-22

### Added
- Added `MVForecaster.add_signals()` for multivariate stacking.
- Added `Forecaster.add_series()` to make multivariate RNNs possible.
- Added `return_train_only` in the `util.find_optimal_transformation()` function to add additional leaking-prevention measures to this function.
- Added padding options in `Forecaster.ingest_Xvars_df()`.
- Added `exclude_models` argument to `Reverter.fit_transform()`.
### Changed
- `SeriesTransformer` no longer deletes attributes after reverting, making the object more reusable.
- `Reverter` objects always copy the passed `Forecaster` objects to make them more flexible and able to be used in more multivariate contexts.
- Added `__copy__()` and `__deepcopy__()` methods to several objects.
- Removed `Forecaster.add_diffed_terms()`.
- Changed how `Forecaster.add_lagged_terms()` deals with the introduction of N/A values -- just warn instead of chopping observations.
- Changed how `train_only` arguments are read in `SeriesTransformer` when there is no test_length in the `Forecaster` object. If test_length is 0, then `train_only` behaves as if it were False.
### Fixed
- Fixed how exogenous variables are read in `util.find_optimal_lag_order()`.
- `train_only` was being ignored in `SeriesTransformer.DeseasonTransform()`.

## [0.18.1] - 2023-04-14
### Added
- Added functions to create expanding dynamic intervals using the conformal framework with backtesting: `util.backtest_for_resid_matrix()`, `util.get_backtest_resid_matrix()`, and `util.overwrite_forecast_intervals()`.
- Added a check for the correct estimator type with `Forecaster.auto_Xvar_select()`.
### Changed
### Fixed
- Fixed `Forecaster.export_Xvars_df()`, which wasn't working correctly when exogenous regressors were added with `Forecaster.ingest_Xvars_df()`.

## [0.18.0] - 2023-04-13
### Added
- Added tbats model.
- `MVForecaster` can now have Xvars added to it.
- Added `multiseries.line_up_dates()` function.
- New argument `test_again` added to `Forecaster.manual_forecast()` and `MVForecaster.manual_forecast()`. `auto_forecast()` in the same objects has the same new argument.
- `model` argument added to `Forecaster.save_feature_importance()` and doesn't have to be called right after a model is evaluated.
- Added `verbose` args to `cross_validate()` and `util.find_optimal_transformation()` functions to offer more transparency around these processes.
- Added `min_grid_size` argument to `Forecaster.limit_grid_size()` and `tune_test_forecast()`.
### Changed
- Distinction between level/non-level is no longer tracked within `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster` objects and all methods that facilitated with that have gone away (`diff()`, `integrate()`, etc). Use `SeriesTransformer` to gain the same plus more functionality.
- Cross validation and tuning faster due to using more efficient objects.
- Cross validation has more customization available.
- RNNs and naive models can be optimized using grid search.
- All forecasting functions rewritten to be more efficient by using more efficient objects and fewer loops.
- Added `Forecaster.chop_from_front()` and `Forecaster.chop_from_back()` methods.
- Less information stored in history.
- Can only refer to series with default or user-selected names within `MVForecaster`.
- The structure of `MVForecaster` has changed. `mvf.y` is a dictionary with series in it instead of being located in `mvf.series1['y']`. The old way was to keep better track of level/nonlevel series but that no longer exists.
- test_only arg is gone in `Forecaster.manual_forecast()` in favor of `Forecaster.test()`, `MVForecaster.test()`. All out-of-sample methods facilited with `chop_from_front()` to split data and ensure no data leaks.
- `MVForecaster.add_optimizer_func()` now accepts functions.
- `MVForecaster.manual_forecast()` now accepts `Xvars` as an argument.
- `normalizer` argument considered a hyperparameter where applicable and not given its own entry in history.
- Got rid of several `Forecaster` methods that are never demonstrated in examples.
- Got rid of `Forecaster.backtest()` and `MVForecaster.backtest()`. `Pipeline.backtest()` and `MVPipeline.backtest()` are better alternatives.
### Fixed
- The first element in m is taken if multiple are passed to `util.find_optimal_transformation()`. The code was taking the second.
- Fixed the diffy arg in `Forecaaster.adf_test()`.
- `cvkwargs` were not being passed to the `cross_validate()` function in `notebook.tune_test_forecast()`.
- `util.find_optimal_transformation()` was only using first value of `m` for seasonal adjustments when multiple were passed.

## [0.17.20] - 2023-04-02
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
- Fixed the `MVPipeline.backtest()` method to return consistent results when a transformation is not taken on the `Forecaster` objects.

## [0.17.19] - 2023-04-01
### Added
### Changed
- `util.find_optimal_transformation()` now uses pipeline backtesting, making it harder to leak data into the decision and also to make cross validation possible.

### Added
- `Forecaster`/`MVForecaster` objects pickled in now re-initiate warning logging for estimated models.
### Changed
### Fixed

## [0.17.16] - 2023-03-29
### Added
- Added `util.metrics.abias()` function.
### Changed
- Revamped the RNN model. Now accepts exogenous regressors and other small changes that I believe will make it faster and more accurate, as well as allow for more customization.
### Fixed
- Fixed the `Pipeline.backtest()` function, which was adding too much space between consecutive training sets.
- Fixed the train_only argument in `SeriesTransformer.DetrendTransform()` when `loess = True`.

## [0.17.15] - 2023-03-27
### Added
- Added a LOESS detrender (from statsmodels) to the `SeriesTransformer` object. Called using `SeriesTransformer.DetrendTransform()`.
### Changed
- `SeriesTransformer` can seasonally adjust the same series multiple times (to capture multiple seasonalities).
- The `util.find_optimal_transformation()` function now tries a LOESS detrender by default.
### Fixed

### Changed
- Changed how metrics are set when initializing the objects and how they can be set later.
- Changed how metrics can be accepted in `util.backtest_metrics()`.

- Took out an error when setting validation metric to R2 and less than 2 obs in validation set. Because of cross validation, this error isn't applicable.
### Fixed
- Fixed `Forecaster.set_metrics()` method.
 
## [0.17.7] - 2023-02-24
### Added
### Changed
- Code refactoring to gain efficiency and make coding base more maintainable. Better practices being followed.
- Users can now choose which metrics to evaluate for any forecasting procedure. The defaults remain what they always were.
- Changed the documentation in a few key spots to (hopefully) be clearer. For example, `Forecaster._estimators_` global is now `Forecaster().estimator` attribute. This also makes pickling more convenient.

### Added
### Changed
- Explicitly specify `dtype = float` for parts of code that raise a warning when this is not the case.

### Fixed

## [0.17.1] - 2023-02-08

- Removed a warning from `Forecaster.ingest_Xvars_df()` that shouldn't have been raised.

## [0.17.0] - 2023-02-06
### Added
- Added the `cis` argument to `Forecaster__init__()` and `MVForecaster.__init__()`.
### Changed
- Only conformal intervals now supported in `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster`. By default, these will not be generated and can only be generated if there is a test set and it is specified to a sufficient length.

- `Forecaster.proba_forecast()` now uses conformal prediction from the mapie package to create confidence intervals and is much more efficient. This will be also implemented in `MVForecaster` soon.
- Took out 'CIPlusMinus' as a history key in `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster`.
### Fixed

## [0.16.3] - 2023-01-29

### Fixed

## [0.15.7] - 2022-10-28
### Added
### Changed
- changed `dynamic_testing = <int>` to same way it was in 0.12.8 when it was introduced because it gives better and more efficient results in both `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster`.
### Fixed

## [0.15.6] - 2022-10-25
### Added
### Changed
- the `m` argument in `util.find_optimal_transformation` can be a list and multiple seasonal differences can be tried in that function
- changed how level plotting is peformed in `Forecaster.plot()` and `Forecaster.plot_test_set()`
### Fixed
- fixed how history['LevelY'] attribute is undifferenced in `SeriesTransformer`, which was causing plots to be incorrect.

## [0.15.5] - 2022-10-22
### Added
- added the `Pipeline.MVPipeline` object.
### Changed
### Fixed

## [0.15.4] - 2022-10-21

### Changed
- changed setup.py so that version needs to be added manually to make an update (#16).
- `Forecaster.integrate()` now has `**kwargs` that are passed to `Forecaster.adf_test()`.
- changed some data processing in `SeriesTransform.DiffRevert()` to accomodate a future change from pandas.
- changed the name of `util.find_series_transformation()` to `util.find_statistical_transformation()`. this function is new as of 0.15.0 so hopefully it has not been adopted widely yet and this change doesn't cause issues for users.
- added a try/except wrapper around the `self.f.typ_set()` code in `SeriesTransformer.DetrendTransform()`
### Fixed
- drops null values before running though `Forecaster.normality_test()`.

## [0.15.1] - 2022-10-18
### Added

- added `SeriesTransformer.SqrtTransform()` and `SeriesTransformer.SqrtRevert()` functions.
### Changed
- two-level differencing no longer natively supported in `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster`. it's too much work to maintain two differencing and it is also supported more efficiently and dynamically through the `SeriesTransformer` object and that is available for who needs it.
  - this changed the arguments in the following functions:
    - [`Forecaster.diff()`](https://scalecast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Forecaster/Forecaster.html#src.scalecast.Forecaster.Forecaster.diff)
    - [`Forecaster.integrate()`](https://scalecast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Forecaster/Forecaster.html#src.scalecast.Forecaster.Forecaster.integrate)
    - [`Forecaster.undiff()`](https://scalecast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Forecaster/Forecaster.html#src.scalecast.Forecaster.Forecaster.undiff)
    - [`util.pdr_load()`](https://scalecast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Forecaster/Util.html#module-src.scalecast.util.pdr_load)
- changed accepted values that can be passed to the `probabilistic` arg in the `Forecaster.tune_test_forecast()`, `MVForecaster.tune_test_forecast()`, and `notebook.tune_test_forecast()` functions so that some models can be forecasted probabilistically and others don't have to be (speeds up processing time generally).
### Fixed
- issues with second-differencing have all been resolved since second differencing is no longer supported natively in the `Forecaster` object.
- took out `revert_fvs` from `SeriesTransformer.DiffRevert()` function because it hasn't been working.

### Added
- `util.pdr_load()` now accepts multiple series and returns an MVForecaster object of everything loaded together

- added a vecm grid to the example grids
- added the `util.find_optimal_coint_rank()` and `util.find_optimal_lag_order()` functions
### Changed
- changed scaling syntax in `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster` to circumvent a warning having to do with feature names--only numpy arrays are scaled now (not dataframes)
### Fixed
- added a call of `Forecaster.Forecaster.typ_set()` right after `MVForecater.__init__()`, before chopping dates to fix weird loading errors that occured once in a while
- fixed the util function that wasn't working in 0.14.2 and yanked that release. everything scheduled for 0.14.3 will now be part of 0.14.4.

## [0.14.1] - 2022-09-09
### Added
- if there are not enough observations to use in cross validation (usually because too many AR terms were added), an error is raised when calling the `Forecater.cross_validate()` and `MVForecaster.cross_validation()` functions

- made cross validation slightly more efficient
### Fixed
- changed some source code to reduce the amount of `TypeError`s a user is likely to get (such as passing `int.64` type when `int` type is required)

## [0.13.3] - 2022-07-27
### Added
### Changed
- `SeriesTransformer.diffrevert()` now supports an argument `revert_fvs`, which is `True` by default. since adding level cis, this is now possible.
### Fixed
- fixed an issue that caused model evaluation to fail if models were not tuned from the grid successfully. this was an issue since 0.12.3 due to how cross validation changed tuning.

### Changed
- deprecated several export functions and rewrote `Forecaster.export()` and `MVForecaster.export()` to allow confidence intervals when `cis=True`. all deprecated functions should log a FutureWarning and will be removed in 0.14.0. all of these functionalities are now dupliated in `Forecaster.export()` and `MVForecaster.export()`

### Added
- added probabilistic forecasting through `Forecaster.proba_forecast()` and `MVForecaster.proba_forecast()` methods
- added level confidence intervals always for models run at level (so it won't fail to generate cis anymore when passing `Forecaster.plot(ci=True,level=True)`)
- probabilistic forecasting also makes it possible to derive level confidence intervals even when model was run at difference
- added probabilistic as a `bool` argument to `Forecaster.tune_test_forecast()`, `MVForecaster.tune_test_forecast()`, and `notebook.tune_test_forecast()` functions
### Changed
- changed how it was determined that a model was tuned for efficiency gains
- changed so that "Dynamically" does not appear in the history['tuned'] attribute
- changed the error that is raised when reduce_Xvars() doesn't work due to feature importance not being supported by a given model so that it is more explicit
- changed the default mlp grid so that random_state is no longer a value. this makes that model more ammenable to probabilistic forecasting
### Fixed

## [0.12.9] - 2022-07-15
### Added
- added `suffix` argument to `Forecaster.tune_test_forecast()`, `MVForecaster.tune_test_forecast()`, and `notebook.tune_test_forecast()` functions (#5)

### Fixed

## [0.12.7] - 2022-07-08
### Added
### Changed
- got rid of printing when calling `ChangepointDetector.WriteCPtoXvars()`

### Added
- added `jump_back` parameter in `Forecaster.backtest()` and `MVForecaster.backtest()` methods
- added the theta model from darts
### Changed

## [0.12.4] - 2022-06-28
### Added
### Changed
- changed how shap feature scores are sorted in reduce Xvars, no adjustment needed like with PFI
### Fixed

## [0.12.3] - 2022-06-27
### Added
- added shap feature importances in addition to pfi by allowing user to select method = 'shap' when calling `Forecaster.save_feature_importance()`
- added shap library to dependencies list
- added `SeriesTransformer` class
- added `AnomalyDetector` class
- added function to util that breaks an `MVForecaster` class into several objects of `Forecaster` class
- can now init `Forecaster` object with `require_future_dates = False`. when using False, the object will not forecast into future dates and will not make you know values into the future for regressors passed through `Forecast.ingest_Xvars_df()`.
### Changed
- took the 'per' key out of the history attribute
- changed the order of some of the source code to be more efficient (very small gains)
- changed the size of the dataset that pfi feature importance is called on to make it include all values previously seen by any given model passed to it. before, it sliced off the last couple observations only -- this was more or less a mistake but I don't expect results will be affected significantly for anyone using `reduce_Xvars()` due to how features are sorted in that function.
- changed the `Forecaster.reset()` function so that it **returns** a true copy of the initiated object.
- in `Forecaster.save_feature_importance()`, added the `on_error` arg to raise errors if the user prefers. The default is still to log errors as warnings so as not to break loops.
### Fixed
- `test_only` was not working with the lstm estimator, so fixed that
- fixed an issue where the function didn't ignore the argument passed to `estimator` with `reduce_Xvars(method='l1')`

### Added
### Changed
- changed how the validation set length is calculated in history attributed -- given na value if cross validation used to tune models
### Fixed
- fixed an issue caused by None values in hyperparam grids being changed to np.nan and therefore not accepted in some functions after cross validation has been called

## [0.11.0] - 2022-06-14
### Added
- added `cross_validate()` methods to `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster` objects, which can now be used for the same purposes as `tune()` but with cross validation
- added `cross_validate` as a (bool) argument to the `Forecaster.tune_test_forecast()`, `Forecaster.reduce_Xvars()`, `MVForecaster.tune_test_forecast()`, and `notebook.tune_test_forecast()` functions
- added "CrossValidated" key to history dict in `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster` objects

### Fixed


## [0.10.5] - 2022-06-07
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
- fixed the `set_best_model()` method in `MVForecaster`, which was broken due to not being able to parse new updates from 0.10.1

## [0.10.4] - 2022-06-05
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
- sorting from pfi variable reduction method was incorrect after initial variable drop, causing the wrong sequence of variables to be dropped when method = 'pfi'

### Fixed

## [0.10.1] - 2022-05-16
### Added
- `MVForecaster.set_optimize_on()` now accepts user functions (like weighted averages) by leveraging new `MVForecaster.add_optimizer_func()` function
### Changed
- Suppressed future warnings on import because of a pandas warning caused from importing LightGBM. If LightGBM does not fix this issue with an update, we might need to pull it from the default list of sklearn estimators; users would still be able to use LightGBM by importing it manually.
### Fixed

## [0.10.0] - 2022-05-13
### Added
- added permutated feature dataset to history for sklearn models with feature importance
### Changed
- changed some pandas syntax to avoid some warnings
- permutation feature importance applied on test set only and works better on models run `test_only = True`

## [0.9.9] - 2022-05-12
### Added
### Changed
- warning logs now called after `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster` objects are initiated

## [0.6.8] - 2022-03-15
### Added

- added `multiseries.export_model_summaries()` function
### Changed
### Fixed

- LSTM model can no longer be tuned
- Got rid of all lstm model grids
- changed `__str__()` and `__repr__()` so that they now offer better info
### Fixed
- Fixed the LSTM model by scaling the dependent variable and unscaling it (minmax) when it comes out and getting rid of other Xvars

- Added source code (commented out) to get level confidence intervals -- when I tested, the intervals were too large to implement but maybe in the future this will be revisited
### Changed
### Fixed

## [0.4.4] - 2022-01-07
### Added
- added lstm grid in example grids
- added EarlyStopping callback functionality for the LSTM model
- added `get_expanded_lstm_grid()` to GridGenerator module which gives an example of a grid with early stopping
### Changed
- changed default paramaters for the lstm model
- added `**kwargs` to the lstm model forecast function that are passed to the `fit()` function in TensorFlow, got rid of `epochs` and `batch_size` args consequently
### Fixed

## [0.4.25] - (quick fix) 2022-01-06
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
- source code was using `f` instead of `self` when when calling `pop_using_criterion()`

## [0.4.2] - 2022-01-06
### Added
- lstm estimator
- added `pop_using_criterion()` function
### Changed
- Fixed an issue where sklearn models were being fit on the same data twice -- does not change outcomes but the models run faster now
- Output from `_scale()` function is now always a numpy matrix (could have been either that or pandas dataframe before)
- sorted `_estimators_` list
- changed the error message for when importing a grid fails to account for one other possible reason the failure occured
### Fixed

## [0.4.1] - 2021-12-30
### Added
- Can now sort by metric value in `export_all_validation_grids_to_excel()`
### Changed
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where sometimes the incorrect AR terms were being propogated for test-set evaluation only

### Added
### Changed
- deleted the 'scale' normalizer from the mlp grid
### Fixed

### Added
- Added `init_dates` and `levely` attributes
- Added `'Observations'` info to history and `export()`
- Added `'lvl_test_set_predictions'` to export dataframes
### Changed
- Got rid of `first_obs` and `first_dates` attributes and wrote more efficient code to do what they were there for
- More information available when `__str__()` is called
### Fixed
- Fixed what became an issue with the last update in which when calling `add_diffed_terms()` or `add_lagged_terms()`, the level series wasn't accurate due to how undifferencing was being executed. After examining this issue, it became evident that the previous way to undifference forecasts was less efficient than it should have been, this update fixed the issues from the last update and made the code more efficient
- Fixed an issue where AR terms were manipulating the underlying xreg structures so that each forecast were using its own test-set propogated AR values instead of the correct AR values
- Fixed the `export_Xvars_df()` method which wasn't working correctly if at least one forecast hadn't been called first

## [0.3.8] - 2021-12-29
### Added
- added the following functions that can each add additional Xvars to forecast with:
	- `add_exp_terms()` - for non polynomial exponential transformations
	- `add_logged_terms()` - for log of any base transformations
	- `add_pt_terms()` - for individual variable power transformations (box cox and yeo johnson available)
	- `add_diffed_terms()` - to difference non-y terms
	- `add_lagged_terms()` - to lag non-y terms
- added the 'pt' normalizer for yeo-johnson normalization (in addition to 'minmax', 'normalize', and 'scale')
- added the `drop_Xvars()` function that is identical to the `drop_regressors()` function
### Changed
- imports all sklearn models as soon as scalecast is imported
- src code cleanup with better coding practices when it comes to forecasting sklearn models (no more copying and pasting new functions)
- changed several set data types to lists in src code
- changed the names of some hidden functions
- other src code cleanup for readability and minor efficiency gains
- better in-line comments and docstring documentation
- got rid of quiet paramater in `save_summary_stats()` and `save_feature_importance()` and now these simply log any problems as warnings
- time trends now start at 1 instead of 0 (makes log transformations possible)
- observation dropping for AR terms in sklearn models now based on the number of N/A values in each AR term instead of just the AR number
- changed some example grids to include the pt normalizer
### Fixed
- now logs all warnings

## [0.3.7] - 2021-12-27
### Added
- `dynamic_testing` argument to `manual_forecast()` and `auto_forecast()` functions -- this is `True` by default (makes all testing comparable between sklearn/non-sklearn models)
- `dynamic_tuning` argument to `tune()` function -- this is `False` by default to majorly improve speed in some applications
### Changed
- native Forecaster warnings will be logged
### Fixed

## [0.3.6] - 2021-12-14
### Added
- added `tune_test_forecast()` function to notebook module to create a progress bar when using a notebook
### Changed
### Fixed
- fixed an issue with `Forecaster.ingest_Xvars_df()` when `use_future_dates=False` causing an error to be raised

## [0.3.5] - 2021-12-07
### Added
- added `include_traing` parameter to `notebook.results_vis()` function
### Changed
### Fixed
- fixed `print_attr` parameter default in `notebook.results_vis()`

## [0.3.4] - 2021-12-07
### Added
- added `results_vis()` notebook function (requires ipywidgets)
- added `Forecaster.export_Xvars_df()` function
- added `max_integration` argument to the `Forecaster.integrate()` function
### Changed
### Fixed

## [0.3.3] - 2021-11-26
### Added
### Changed
- Now reloads Grids file each time `ingest_grid()` is called so that notebooks do not have to be rerun when a grid cannot be found
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with some sklearn estimators that occurs when passing a subset of regressors in a list to the forecast function

## [0.3.2] - 2021-11-01
#### Added
#### Changed
#### Fixed
- Found an issue when using `floor` in Prophet

## [0.3.1] - 2021-10-29
#### Added
- Added the eCommerce example
- In `limit_grid_size()`, users can now set random_seed parameter for consistent results
#### Changed
#### Fixed
- Scikit-learn models were not accepting `Xvars='all'` as an arguments
- Fixed an issue causing models run at different levels to error out sometimes when plotted
- Fixed a plotting error that occured sometimes when setting models parameter to `None`

## [0.3.0] - 2021-10-15
#### Added
- Added an option to save to png in plot(), plot_test_set(), and plot_fitted() methods using plt.savefig() from matplotlib and calling with `to_png = True`
#### Changed
- Made errors more descriptive, stripping out AssertionError types 
#### Fixed
- fixed typos in doc strings

## [0.2.9] - 2021-09-27
#### Added
#### Changed
- In plot() method, `models=None` is now accepted and will plot only actual values
- Example grids are modified to prevent overfitting in some models
#### Fixed
- Fixed the add_time_trend() method to not skip a time step in the first observation

## [0.2.8] - 2021-08-27
#### Added
- Added a descriptive error when all_feature_info_to_excel() or all_validation_grids_to_excel() fails
#### Changed
- Using pd.shift() instead of np.roll() to create AR terms to avoid further issues with AR terms
- Prophet, silverkite, and ARIMA have better Xvar validation mechanisms to ensure that autoregressive terms aren't fed to them, which could cause errors and doesn't add anything to the models that isn't already built into them. Now, even if a user tries to feed AR terms only, it will pass no Xvars to these models
#### Fixed
- AR terms were not dropping the correct first observations before being estimated with SKLEARN models, so we fixed that but it didn't seem to make a noticeable difference in any of the examples 

## [0.2.7] - 2021-08-20
#### Added
- added reset() function that deletes all regressors and resets the object to how it was initiated
- added documentation and hints in the source code
#### Changed
- changed readme documentation to be more concise
#### Fixed
- in the documentation, it was stated that the 'scale' value passed to the 'normalize' parameter when calling manual_forecast() or auto_forecast() would use a StandardScaler from sklearn, but a Normalizer was actually being applied. Now, you can pass 'scale' to get the StandardScaler, 'normalize' to get the Normalizer, or 'minmax' to get the MinMaxScaler (unchanged from previous distributions). 'minmax' is still the default for all estimators that accept this argument

## [0.2.6] - 2021-08-12
#### Added
- added train_only argument to following functions to reduce data leakage in eda/preprocessing steps: integrate, adf_test, plot_acf, plot_pacf, plot_periodogram, seasonal_decompose -- default argument is still False for these. Now it is suggested to set a test length before running any one of these methods and only examine the training set correlations to prevent data leakage
#### Changed
#### Fixed

## [0.2.5] - 2021-08-09
#### Added
- added integrate() method that can be used to automatically find the series appropriate level to achieve stationarity, according to augmented dickey fuller test
#### Changed
#### Fixed

## [0.2.4] - 2021-08-03
#### Added
- added tune_test_forecast() function that allows what used to take four lines to be aggregated into one, also allows more easy saving of feature information by setting feature_importance or summary_stats parameters to True
- added all_feature_info_to_excel() function
- added all_validation_grids_to_excel() function
#### Changed
#### Fixed
- removed a duplicate column from the dataframe created when calling the export() method

## [0.2.3] - 2021-07-19
#### Added
#### Changed
- changed removed pandas-datareader from imports in setup.py since it is not a package dependency (change having to do with installation only and should not affect anything when applying the library)
#### Fixed

## [0.2.2] - 2021-07-16
#### Added
- added GridGenerator module so user can more easily create grids in working directory
#### Changed
- changed all functions with diffy parameter (plot_acf, plot_pacf, seasonal_decompose) now accept True, False, 0, 1, or 2 as possible values
#### Fixed
- fixed issues with two-level undifferencing where it was adding values exponentially because the level was being added to the first and second-level differences
- fixed issues with two-level undifferencing where dates were being mixed up
- fixed issues with one-level test-set evaluation where the incorrect initial value was set to undifference values in the test-set only, causing miscalculation of metrics, although the bias was in both directions so when rerunning avocados.ipynb, for example, the results were virtually the same with different models now outperforming others but metrics remaining more or less the same on average; forecasted values did not change

## [0.1.9] - 2021-07-09
#### Added
- added lightgbm and silverkite as estimators
#### Changed
- changed 'which' parameter in set_valiation_metric() to 'metric' for clarity
- changed 'which' parameter in set_estimator() to 'estimator' for clarity
#### Fixed

## [0.1.8] - 2021-07-05
#### Added
#### Changed
#### Fixed
- fixed an error in combo modeling that was causing incorrect applications of weights in weighted averaging -- the weights were generating correctly but not being applied to the best-performing models in the correct order

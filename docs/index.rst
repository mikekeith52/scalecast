Forecasting with Python has never been easier.

.. code:: python
   
   import pandas as pd
   from scalecast.Forecaster import Forecaster
   from scalecast import GridGenerator

   GridGenerator.get_example_grids()

   data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
   f = Forecaster(
      y = data['values'],
      current_dates = data['date'],
      future_dates = 24, # forecast horizon
   )
   f.set_estimator('xgboost')

   f.auto_Xvar_select()
   f.cross_validate(k=3)
   f.auto_forecast()

   results = f.export(['lvl_fcsts','model_summaries'])

Dynamic Recursive Forecasting
--------------------------------

Scalecast allows you to use a series' lags (autoregressive, or AR, terms) as inputs by employng a dynamic recursive forecasting method to generate predictions and validate all models out-of-sample.

Dynamic Recursive Forecasting with Peeking
------------------------------------------------------------

The recrursive process can be tweaked to allow the model to "peek" at real values during the testing phase. You can choose after how many steps the model is allowed to do this by specifying `dynamic_testing=<int>`. The advantage here is that you can report your test-set metrics as an average of rolling smaller-step forecasts to glean a better idea about how well your algorithm can predict over a specific forecast horizon. You can also select models that are optimized on a given forecast horizon.

`dynamic_testing=True` is the default and `dynamic_testing=1` or `dynamic_testing=False` means the test-set metrics are averages of one-step forecasts.

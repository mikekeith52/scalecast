        ## About
        
        Scalecast is a light-weight modeling procedure, wrapper, and results container meant for those who are looking for the fastest way possible to apply, tune, and validate many different model classes for forecasting applications. In the Data Science industry, it is often asked of practitioners to deliver predictions and ranges of predictions for several lines of businesses or data slices, 100s or even 1000s. In such situations, it is common to see a simple linear regression or some other quick procedure applied to all lines due to the complexity of the task. This works well enough for people who need to deliver *something*, but more can be achieved.  
        
        The scalecast package was designed to address this situation and offer advanced machine learning models that can be applied, optimized, and validated quickly. Unlike many libraries, the predictions produced by scalecast are always dynamic by default, not averages of one-step forecasts, so you don't run into the situation where the estimator looks great on the test-set but can't generalize to real data. What you see is what you get, with no attempt to oversell results. If you download a library that looks like it's able to predict the COVID pandemic in your test-set, you probably have a one-step forecast happening under-the-hood. You can't predict the unpredictable, and you won't see such things with scalecast.  
        
        The library provides the `Forecaster` (for one series) and `MVForecaster` (for multiple series) wrappers around the following estimators:

        ## Example
        
        Let's say we wanted to forecast each of the 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, and 30-year corporate bond rates through the next 12 months. There are two ways we could do this with scalecast:  
        1. Forecast each series individually (univariate): they will only have their own histories and any exogenous regressors we add to make forecasts. One series is predicted forward dynamically at a time.  
        2. Forecast all series together (multivariate): they will have their own histories, exogenous regressors, and each other's histories to make forecasts. All series will be predicted forward dynamically at the same time.    
        
        
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
        from scalecast.Forecaster import Forecaster
        from scalecast.MVForecaster import MVForecaster
        from scalecast import GridGenerator
        from scalecast.multiseries import export_model_summaries
        import pandas_datareader as pdr
        
        sns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(14,7)})
        
        df = pdr.get_data_fred(
            ['HQMCB1YR','HQMCB5YR','HQMCB10YR','HQMCB20YR','HQMCB30YR'],
            start='2000-01-01',
            end='2022-03-01'
        )
        
        f_dict = {c: Forecaster(y=df[c],current_dates=df.index) for c in df}
        ```
        
        ### Option 1 - Univariate
        
        #### Select Models
        
        
        ```python
        models = (
            'arima',       # linear time series model
            'elasticnet',  # linear model with regularization
            'knn',         # nearest neighbor model
            'xgboost',     # boosted tree model
        )
        ```
        
        #### Create Grids
        These grids will be used to tune each model. To get example grids, you can use:  
        
        ```python
        GridGenerator.get_example_grids()
        ```
        
        This saves a Grids.py file to your working directory by default, which scalecast knows how to read. In this example, we create our own grids:  
        
        
        ```python
        arima_grid = dict(
            order = [(1,1,1),(0,1,1),(0,1,0)],
            seasonal_order = [(1,1,1,12),(0,1,1,12),(0,1,0,12)],
            Xvars = [None,'all']
        )
        
        elasticnet_grid = dict(
            l1_ratio = [0.25,0.5,0.75,1],
            alpha = np.linspace(0,1,100),
        )
        
        knn_grid = dict(
            n_neighbors = np.arange(2,100,2)
        )
        
        xgboost_grid = dict(
             n_estimators=[150,200,250],
             scale_pos_weight=[5,10],
             learning_rate=[0.1,0.2],
             gamma=[0,3,5],
             subsample=[0.8,0.9],
        )
        
        grid_list = [arima_grid,elasticnet_grid,knn_grid,xgboost_grid]
        grids = dict(zip(models,grid_list))
        ```
        
        #### Select test length, validation length, and forecast horizon
        
        
        ```python
        def prepare_fcst(f):
            f.set_test_length(0.2)
            f.set_validation_length(12)
            f.generate_future_dates(12)
        ```
        
        #### Add seasonal regressors
        These are regressors like month, quarter, dayofweek, dayofyear, minute, hour, etc. Raw integer values, dummy variables, or fourier transformed variables. They are determined by the series' own histories.  
        
        
        ```python
        def add_seasonal_regressors(f):
            f.add_seasonal_regressors('month',raw=False,sincos=True)
            f.add_seasonal_regressors('year')
            f.add_seasonal_regressors('quarter',raw=False,dummy=True,drop_first=True)
        ```
        
        #### Choose Autoregressive Terms
        A better way to do this would be to examine each series individually for autocorrelation. This example uses three lags for each series and one seasonal seasonal lag (assuming 12-month seasonality).
        
        
        ```python
        def add_ar_terms(f):
            f.add_ar_terms(3)       # lags
            f.add_AR_terms((1,12))  # seasonal lags
        ```
        
        #### Write the forecast procedure
        
        
        ```python
        def tune_test_forecast(k,f,models):
            for m in models:
                print(f'forecasting {m} for {k}')
                f.set_estimator(m)
                f.ingest_grid(grids[m])
                f.tune()
                f.auto_forecast()
        ```
        
        #### Run a forecast loop
        
        
        ```python
        for k, f in f_dict.items():
            prepare_fcst(f)
            add_seasonal_regressors(f)
            add_ar_terms(f)
            f.integrate(critical_pval=0.01) # takes differences in series until they are stationary using the adf test
            tune_test_forecast(k,f,models)
        ```

        #### Visualize results
        Since there are 5 series to visualize, it might be undesirable to write a plot function for each one. Instead, scalecast lets you leverage Jupyter widgets by using this function:
        
        ```python
        from scalecast.notebook import results_vis
        results_vis(f_dict)
        ```
        
        Because we aren't able to show widgets through markdown, this readme shows a visualization for the 30-year rate only:
        
        ##### Integrated Results
        
        
        ```python
        f.plot_test_set(ci=True,order_by='LevelTestSetMAPE')
        plt.title(f'{k} test-set results',size=16)
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        
            
        ![png](README_files/README_17_0.png)
            
        
        
        ##### Level Results
        
        
        ```python
        f.plot_test_set(level=True,order_by='LevelTestSetMAPE')
        plt.title(f'{k} test-set results',size=16)
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        
            
        ![png](README_files/README_19_0.png)
            
        
        
        Comparing level test-set MAPE values, the K-nearest Neighbor model performed best, although, as we can see, predicting bond rates accurately is difficult if not impossible. To make the forecasts look better, we can set `dynamic_testing=False` in the `manual_forecast()` or `auto_forecast()` methods when calling forecasts. This will make test-set predictions an average on one-step forecasts. By default, everything is dynamic with scalecast to give a more realistic sense of how the models perform. To see our future predictions:
        
        
        ```python
        f.plot(level=True,models='knn')
        plt.title(f'{k} forecast',size=16)
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        
            
        ![png](README_files/README_21_0.png)
            
        
        
        ### View Results
        We can print a dataframe that shows how each model performed on each series.
        
        
        ```python
        results = export_model_summaries(f_dict,determine_best_by='LevelTestSetMAPE')
        results.columns
        ```

        ### Option 2: Multivariate
        
        #### Select Models
        Only sklearn models are available with multivariate forecasting, so we can replace ARIMA with mlr.
        
        
        ```python
        mv_models = (
            'mlr',
            'elasticnet',
            'knn',
            'xgboost',
        )
        ```
        
        #### Create Grids
        We can use three of the same grids as we did in univariate forecasting and create a new MLR grid, with a modification to also search the optimal lag numbers. The `lags` argument can be an `int`, `list`, or `dict` type and all series will use the other series' lags (as well as their own lags) in each model that is called, unless we tell the models to not use a certain series' lags for whatever reason. Again, for mv forecasting, we can save default grids:  
        
        ```python
        GridGenerator.get_mv_grids()
        ```
        
        This creates the MVGrids.py file in our working directory by default, which scalecast knows how to read.  
        
        
        ```python
        mlr_grid = dict(lags = np.arange(1,13,1))
        elasticnet_grid['lags'] = np.arange(1,13,1)
        knn_grid['lags'] = np.arange(1,13,1)
        xgboost_grid['lags'] = np.arange(1,13,1)
        
        mv_grid_list = [mlr_grid,elasticnet_grid,knn_grid,xgboost_grid]
        mv_grids = dict(zip(mv_models,mv_grid_list))
        ```
        
        ### Create multivariate forecasting object
        - Need to change test and validation length
        - Regressors are already carried forward from the underlying `Forecaster` objects
        - Integrated levels are also carried forward from the underlying `Forecaster` objects
        
        
        ```python
        mvf = MVForecaster(
            *f_dict.values(),
            names = f_dict.keys(),
        )
        
        mvf.set_test_length(.2)
        mvf.set_validation_length(12)
        mvf
        ```
        
        
        
        
            MVForecaster(
                DateStartActuals=2000-02-01T00:00:00.000000000
                DateEndActuals=2022-03-01T00:00:00.000000000
                Freq=MS
                N_actuals=266
                N_series=5
                SeriesNames=['HQMCB1YR', 'HQMCB5YR', 'HQMCB10YR', 'HQMCB20YR', 'HQMCB30YR']
                ForecastLength=12
                Xvars=['monthsin', 'monthcos', 'year', 'quarter_2', 'quarter_3', 'quarter_4']
                TestLength=53
                ValidationLength=12
                ValidationMetric=rmse
                ForecastsEvaluated=[]
                CILevel=0.95
                BootstrapSamples=100
                CurrentEstimator=mlr
                OptimizeOn=mean
            )
        
        
        
        ### Choose how to optimize the models when tuning hyperparameters
        Default behavior is use the mean performance of each model on all series. We don't have to run the line below to keep this behavior, but we also have the option to use this code to optimize on the min/max error across all series, a weighted average of the error across the series, or to only consider one series' error over all others. See the [docs](https://scalecast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Forecaster/MVForecaster.html#src.scalecast.MVForecaster.MVForecaster.add_optimizer_func) for more info.
        
        
        ```python
        mvf.set_optimize_on('mean')
        ```
        
        #### Write Forecasting Procedure
        - Instead of grid search, we will use randomized grid search to speed up evaluation times
        
        
        ```python
        for m in mv_models:
            print(f'forecasting {m}')
            mvf.set_estimator(m)
            mvf.ingest_grid(mv_grids[m])
            mvf.limit_grid_size(100,random_seed=20) # do this because now grids are larger and this speeds it up
            mvf.tune()
            mvf.auto_forecast()
        ```
        
            forecasting mlr
            forecasting elasticnet
            forecasting knn
            forecasting xgboost
            
        
        ### Set best model
        
        
        ```python
        mvf.set_best_model(determine_best_by='LevelTestSetMAPE')
        mvf.best_model
        ```
        
        
        
        
            'knn'
        
        
        
        The elasticnet model was chosen based on its average test-set MAPE performance on all series.
        
        #### Visualize results
        Multivariate forecasting allows us to view all series and all models together. This could get jumbled, so let's just see the mlr and elasticnet results, knowing we can see the others if we want later.
        
        ##### Integrated Results
        
        
        ```python
        mvf.plot_test_set(ci=True,models=['mlr','elasticnet'])
        plt.title(f'test-set results',size=16)
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        
            
        ![png](README_files/README_39_0.png)
            
        
        
        ##### Level Results
        
        
        ```python
        mvf.plot_test_set(level=True,models=['mlr','elasticnet'])
        plt.title(f'test-set results',size=16)
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        
            
        ![png](README_files/README_41_0.png)
            
        
        
        Once again, in this object, we can also set `dynamic_testing=False` in the `manual_forecast()` or `auto_forecast()` methods when calling forecasts. This would make our plots and metrics look better, but not be realistic in the sense it wouldn't show how well our forecasts could predict more than one period in the future. Let's see model forecasts into the future using the elasticent model only:
        
        
        ```python
        mvf.plot(level=True,models='elasticnet')
        plt.title(f'forecasts',size=16)
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        
            
        ![png](README_files/README_43_0.png)
            
        
        
        ### View Results
        We can print a dataframe that shows how each model did on each series.
        
        
        ```python
        mvresults = mvf.export_model_summaries()
        mvresults.columns
        ```
        
        
        
        
            Index(['Series', 'ModelNickname', 'Estimator', 'Xvars', 'HyperParams', 'Lags',
                   'Scaler', 'Observations', 'Tuned', 'CrossValidated',

                   'MetricOptimized', 'best_model'],
                  dtype='object')
        
        
        
        
        ```python

        ## Backtest results
        To test how well, on average, our models would have done across the last-10 12-month forecast horizons, we can use the `backtest()` method. It works for both the `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster` objects.
        
        
        ```python
        mvf.backtest('elasticnet')
        mvf.export_backtest_metrics('elasticnet')
        ```

        ## Correlation Matrices
        - If you want to see how correlated the series are in your `MVForecaster` object, you can use these correlation matrices  
        
        ### All Series, no lags
        
        
        ```python
        heatmap_kwargs = dict(
            disp='heatmap',
            vmin=-1,
            vmax=1,
            annot=True,
            cmap = "Spectral",
        )
        mvf.corr(**heatmap_kwargs)
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        
            
        ![png](README_files/README_50_0.png)
            
        
        
        ### Two series, with lags
        
        
        ```python
        mvf.corr_lags(y='HQMCB1YR',x='HQMCB30YR',lags=12,**heatmap_kwargs)
        plt.show()
        ```

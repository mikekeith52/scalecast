## About

Scalecast helps you forecast time series. What sets it apart from other libraries is its pipelining functionality. The unique approach not only allows a series to be transformed to account for stationarity and other concerns, but also fully reverted when results are ready to be reported. Point forecasts, test-set metrics, and conformal confidence intervals are easily obtained at the original series level through this process. Uniform ML modeling (with models from a diverse set of libraries, including scikit-learn, statsmodels, and tensorflow), reporting, and data visualizations are offered through the `Forecaster` and `MVForecaster` interfaces. Data storage and processing then becomes easy as all applicable data, predictions, and many derived metrics are contained in a few objects with much customization available through different modules. [Feature requests and issue reporting](https://github.com/mikekeith52/scalecast/issues/new) are welcome!
